      Baseball is great. I love it. I’m thankful I get to play it, blessed to be able to play it past high school. But at the same time, I know it’s a platform to be able to do other things. We’re just excited we get to do it. We know that baseball is going to end one of these days, hopefully a long time from now. And hopefully we have some things that continue on long, long after we’re gone.
