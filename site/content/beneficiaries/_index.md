### BENEFICIARIES

BULLET POINTS ABOUT LOCATIONS
(This would be the 4 square idea with the small blurb under each box.  Alpha order, please!)

#### Dallas

Dallas is our hometown and hub for the Kershaw’s Challenge team and office. We love giving back to the community and city that holds such a special part of our history. 

#### Los Angeles

For seven months of the year, Los Angeles is the Kershaws’ home away from home. Through Clayton’s career with the Dodgers, the people and the fans have become like family. It is a joy to give back to the city that has given us so much.

#### Africa

Our heartbeat started in Africa when Ellen met a little girl named Hope. Our desire to begin Kershaw’s Challenge stems back to our friends in Zambia. It is our great joy to continue to shine a light on the need and incredible people of Zambia. 

#### Dominican Republic

When Clayton first visited the Dominican Republic, he knew that Kershaw’s Challenge had to get involved. The DR is alive with baseball—many coming to the US to play! We have loved the opportunity to support the great work that is taking place there.
