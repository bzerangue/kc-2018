- Phase Two: Building the school -
  Thanks to Kershawâ€™s Challenge 2017, last year was an incredible year! The Arise Christian School is being built right now! With phase one complete, we will shift our focus to phase two. This phase will include: planning and grading more of the enclosed school land, two new classrooms, the cafeteria, school offices and toilets, the library and school furniture to furnish the classrooms.
