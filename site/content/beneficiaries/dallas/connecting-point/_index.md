#### Connecting Point Park Cities :: Dallas, Texas

- Provide scholarship funds for “teammates,” funds for additional staffing needs, programs and future planning.

Connecting Point seeks to provide families and individuals with quality, stimulating, and all-inclusive programs for young adults with disabilities. We would love to help make Connecting Point available to more teammates through scholarship funding. Additionally, we would love to support the programs and staffing needs. Finally, we are excited to help their organization grow and plan for the future in meeting the needs of a population that is living longer.
