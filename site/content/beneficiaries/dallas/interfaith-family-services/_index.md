#### Interfaith Family Services :: Dallas, Texas

- Build the “Teen Floor” of the new Family Empowerment Center –
  We are so excited about the incredible work of Interfaith Family Services in our hometown of Dallas. Their mission is to “empower families in crisis to break the cycle of poverty.” They exclusively target working poor families, serving homeless parents and children through services designed to eliminate housing barriers, equip parents to obtain viable careers and overcome financial challenges, and educational support services for children. They are ACTIVELY helping families get off the streets and back on their feet. The new Family Empowerment Center is already underway. This “Teen Floor” is a need for them and we feel like it is the perfect fit for Kershaw’s Challenge.
