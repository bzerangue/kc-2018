#### International Justice Mission :: Dominican Republic

Fund the rescue and restore efforts of the IJM Dominican Republic office.

IJMâ€™s mission is to protect the poor from violence by rescuing victims, bringing criminals to justice, restoring survivors to safety and strength, and helping local law enforcement build a safe future that lasts. They are doing remarkable work of rescuing and restoring children trapped in sex slavery in the DR. Specifically, our contribution would allow for the rescue of 9 boys and girls, restore 18 survivors, restrain 13 suspects, and secure the convictions of 13 traffickers. Our support would also begin the system reform program to improve aftercare services and enhance investigations.
