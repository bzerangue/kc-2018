#### Dream Center :: Los Angeles, California

- Sponsor Back to School Bash and build the Kershaw’s Challenge Playground and Activity Center -

We feel that the Back to School Bash is an awesome, tangible way for us to make an impact in the lives of children living in LA. We would love to sponsor this event again this year. Additionally, we are so excited about the Dream Center’s vision for a playground and activity center. This playground would serve the children and families living at the Dream Center and in the surrounding area. Currently many of the children are forced to play in the hallways of the Dream Center because of safety hazards around the neighborhood.

#### Just Keep Livin’ :: Los Angeles, California

- Implement the Just Keep Livin’ afterschool program and curriculum into a LA school.

We have gotten to know the work of JKL over the past several years. We love the tangible ways they are serving children and school in LA. We would love to bring JKL into a new LA school. Their program includes fitness, wellness, service and nutrition curriculum to students.
