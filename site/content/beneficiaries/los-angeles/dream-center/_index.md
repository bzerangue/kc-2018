- Sponsor Back to School Bash and build the Kershaw’s Challenge Playground and Activity Center -

We feel that the Back to School Bash is an awesome, tangible way for us to make an impact in the lives of children living in LA. We would love to sponsor this event again this year. Additionally, we are so excited about the Dream Center’s vision for a playground and activity center. This playground would serve the children and families living at the Dream Center and in the surrounding area. Currently many of the children are forced to play in the hallways of the Dream Center because of safety hazards around the neighborhood.
