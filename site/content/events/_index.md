### EVENTS

#### ABOUT KC LIVE

KC LIVE is our country-music benefit concert that we host every year in our hometown of Dallas. For the past four years, KC LIVE has attracted the incredible talents of Clay Walker, Easton Corbin, the Eli Young Band and most recently, Brad Paisley. It is a sold-out concert held at a great Texas country venue, the Rustic. Community members and local Dallas sponsors come to support the incredible work of our beneficiaries in Dallas and Africa.

PingPong4Purpose has quickly become an iconic Los Angeles event. Since 2013, we have hosted a celebrity ping pong tournament on the field at Dodger Stadium. It is night of great competition, food and festivities—including a one-of-a-kind silent auction with incredible sports and Hollywood memorabilia. Celebrities and athletes (including most of Clayton’s teammates) compete is high-energy ping pong tournament, culminating in a wild championship game. The evening has been hosted in the past by Hollywood A-listers Will Ferrell and Jimmy Kimmel. All proceeds go to support our beneficiaries in LA and the Dominican Republic.
